Education
======
* Ph.D. in Molecular and Cell Biology, Division of Genetics and Development, 2002
  * Laboratory of Gerald M. Rubin; University of California, Berkeley, California
* Bachelor of Science in Biology, Magna Cum Laude, 1993
  * Tufts University, College of Arts and Sciences, Medford, Massachusetts

Work experience
======
* Professor of Neuroscience, Biology, and Data Science, 2002 to present
  * Westminster College Salt Lake City, UT
  * Assistant from 2002-2007, Associate 2007-2013, promoted to Professor in 2013
  * Teach courses in Neuroscience and Biology. My teaching is very collaborative, active, and experiential with a focus on data gathering, data analysis, and reading and understanding primary literature. I have created many courses as well as large collections of lab and classroom activities.
  * Mentored dozens of undergraduate research students. Many of these students have continued their studies in graduate and professional programs. My students and I are interested in studying genetic diversity and how it affects the phenotypes of various organisms. For the last few years, we have concentrated on how different genotypes can affect complex behaviors in humans
and the population genetics of the brine shrimp, *Artemia*, from Great Salt Lake in UT.

* PhD candidate and Graduate Student Instructor, 1997-2002
  * Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, UC Berkeley
  * Examined the role of the fly LRP (dLRP) as well as two related mouse proteins, LRP5 and LRP6, in Wnt signaling and development. Including a yeast-two-hybrid screen with the intracellular domain of dLRP to identify new proteins that interact, and biochemical and functional assays in *Drosophila*, *Xenopus*, and *C. elegans* to characterize novel Wnt pathway proteins.
  
* Senior Research Associate, 1995 to 1997
  * Exelixis Inc., San Francisco, CA 
  * Developed gene trapping in mouse ES cells, managed a gene trap screen, and made improvements to the technology.
  
* Research Associate, 1993 to 1995
  * ImmunoGen, Inc., Cambridge, MA
  * Designed, engineered, expressed, and purified humanized antibodies and identified and characterized new molecules involved in programmed cell death.
