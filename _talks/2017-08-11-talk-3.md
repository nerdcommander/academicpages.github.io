As the data that we collect dramatically increases in both quantity and complexity, all college
graduates will need more quantitative and computational skills to be productive and successful
members of society. Ecology students are no exception. Instructors are often looking for efficient and
exciting (or at least non-off-putting) ways to introduce undergraduates early in their careers to the
powerful data analysis tools that they will learn and use later, such as the statistical programming
language, R, without overwhelming introductory students. Our question was: what is the most
accessible and effective framework for teaching quantitative and computational skills in introductory
ecology classes that will meet our learning goals and prepare students for continued development in
statistics and advanced courses?
